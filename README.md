# Optimizing Emergency Medical Service Response Time
This is a web application that gets user's input location and find the nearest hospital using A* algorithm and also show it visually through graph by networkx library. The main features of our project include:

1. Welcome through voice at the start of the app
2. Finding the shortest path to the nearest hospital
3. View location on google maps
4. Visualization by showing graphs
5. Visualization by highlighting the shortest path on the graph


**Front page:**

When the app started the computrized voice welcomes by saying "Welcome to the Emergency service"

This graph displayed is through networkx and matplotlib library. Also user can see the location of that nearest hospital on Google maps.
